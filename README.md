ABSTRACT
This project focuses on developing a hotel website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aim is to provide customers with comprehensive information about the hotel and its services. The website showcases room details with images and includes a customer feedback system. Unlike many existing hotel websites that lack proper mechanisms for handling feedback or grievances, this project emphasizes building an effective customer support feature. Basic PHP and two jQuery plugins are utilized to enhance the interactivity and responsiveness of the website.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past few decades, hotel operations and information systems have evolved significantlyâ€”from simple printed advertisements and manual services to sophisticated, web-based applications. This transformation has been driven by technological advancements, increasing professionalism, and the growing recognition of customer satisfaction as a key priority.

This project introduces a computer-based management system that efficiently presents essential hotel information, including room details and available services. The goal is to enhance user experience by making activities like room searching, booking, feedback submission, and location access seamless and user-friendly. All feedback submitted by visitors will be sent via email to the hotel administration for follow-up.

The project explores various functional requirements of a hotel website and strives to offer a welcoming user interface. Built primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site is enhanced further with basic PHP scripting and dynamic features through jQuery plugins to ensure a responsive and efficient experience.

OBJECTIVES
The primary goal of this project is to develop an informative and interactive hotel website with the following features:

Display of available rooms

Online room booking functionality

Hotel location display

Information on hotel services and amenities

Automatic bill computation

Showcasing of package deals

Email communication facility

Customer feedback system

METHODOLOGY
a. HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational markup language used to structure web pages and applications. Alongside CSS and JavaScript, HTML plays a vital role in rendering multimedia pages in browsers. It provides the semantic structure of content, ensuring consistency across devices and platforms.

b. CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines the visual presentation of HTML content. It allows developers to separate content from design by controlling layout, fonts, colors, and spacing. This leads to improved maintainability, reusability of styles, and consistent user experiences across multiple pages.

c. JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile, multi-paradigm scripting language used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It allows real-time interaction with the Document Object Model (DOM) and is essential for tasks such as form validation, animations, and event handling. Though originally browser-based, JavaScript is now used in server-side and cross-platform development environments as well.

d. jQuery
jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, event handling, and animation. This project incorporates two plugins:

LightBox: Provides a clean and simple way to overlay images on the current page.

ResponsiveSlides.js: Creates responsive image sliders for better mobile compatibility and enhanced design.

INNOVATION AND CONTRIBUTION
This project introduces a customer feedback system, a feature commonly missing on average hotel websites.

While many modern sites rely on advanced technologies like AngularJS and full-stack solutions, this project emphasizes the capability and importance of fundamental web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website helps customers make informed decisions by clearly presenting room options, services, and hotel location, thereby enhancing the likelihood of bookings.
